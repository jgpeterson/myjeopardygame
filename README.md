MY JEOPARDY PROJECT


OVERVIEW

For my first project in WDI12, I creasted a simple Jeopardy game.

Once users enter my site they are asked to select the NEW GAME option. After selecting the NEW GAME they are taken to the jeopardy board where they can pick their first category and question by selecting a dollar amount. Once they choose a price, they are given a question and depending on their answer to said question, their score can increase or decrease. Once the game is over, the player can refresh the page to start a new game.
